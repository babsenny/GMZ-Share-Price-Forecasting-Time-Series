# GMZ-Share-Price-Forecasting-Time-Series
Time series forecasting of GMZ share prices in R, including exploratory decomposition, stationarity checks, ARIMA/ETS modelling, residual diagnostics, and out-of-sample forecast evaluation.


Project Overview

This project applies time series modelling techniques to forecast GMZ share price movements for a financial investment firm. Acting as a Data Scientist, the goal is to develop and compare forecasting models that can generate reliable short-term predictions and support investment decision-making.

The analysis focuses on a single GMZ price series (chosen from Open / Close / High / Low) and follows a complete modelling workflow from exploration through diagnostics, evaluation, and model recommendation.

Objectives

1. Explore and understand GMZ share price behaviour over time (trend, seasonality, volatility).

2. Build multiple time series forecasting models suitable for financial price data.

3. Test modelling assumptions and validate model adequacy using residual diagnostics.

4. Compare models using out-of-sample performance and recommend the best approach for GMZ.
